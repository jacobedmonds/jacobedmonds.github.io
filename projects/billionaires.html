      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project analyzes how billionaire industry representation and median net worth differ
        between countries with high and low gross primary enrollment rates.
        Countries were split into high and low enrollment groups using the global median enrollment rate.

      <h2>Research Questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Do billionaire industries differ between countries with high vs low primary enrollment?</li>
        <li>Does median net worth vary by industry across enrollment groups?</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data & Methodology</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Global billionaire dataset with industry classification and net worth</li>
        <li>Country-level gross primary enrollment rates used as education proxy</li>
        <li>Exploratory comparisons using grouped summaries and faceted visualizations</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Key Findings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Countries with higher primary enrollment rates show more diversified billionaire industries,
          particularly in manufacturing, healthcare, and fashion & retail.
        </li>
        <li>
          Countries with lower enrollment rates tend to have higher median net worth in several industries,
          including finance, logistics, and gambling.
        </li>
        <li>
          The relationship between education and wealth accumulation varies substantially by industry.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Cleaning & Reproducibility</h2>
      <p>
        A separate cleaning pipeline documents how raw billionaire and economic data were merged,
        filtered, and standardized prior to analysis.
